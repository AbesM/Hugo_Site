Hi, I am Seba. I like math. I actually like manifolds and in particular low dimensional topology. While I dreamed to study Hyperbolic Geometry on the path (more like an highway) left behind by William P. Thurston I found myself stuck with 4-dimensional manifolds, where a theory of geometrization is unthinkable of. I guess we will do something anyway!
